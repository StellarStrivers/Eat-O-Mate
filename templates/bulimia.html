        <h1>Bulimia Nervosa</h1>
        <p>Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a cycle of bingeing and compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting designed to undo or compensate for the effects of binge eating.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Binge eating, usually in secret</li>
            <li>Forced vomiting</li>
            <li>Excessive exercise</li>
            <li>Use of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas after eating</li>
            <li>Preoccupation with body shape and weight</li>
            <li>Fear of gaining weight</li>
            <li>Frequent fluctuations in weight</li>
            <li>Damage to the teeth and gums</li>
            <li>Swelling of the cheeks or jaw area</li>
            <li>Dry skin and hair, brittle nails</li>
            <li>Extreme mood swings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to see a doctor?</h2>
        <p>If you or someone you know exhibits symptoms of bulimia nervosa, it is important to seek professional medical help. Early treatment is crucial for recovery. Contact a healthcare provider if you notice signs of binge eating, purging behaviors, or obsessive thoughts about weight and dieting.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>The exact cause of bulimia nervosa is not fully understood. Like other eating disorders, it may be caused by a combination of genetic, biological, emotional, behavioral, psychological, and social factors.</p>
        <h3>Biological</h3>
        <p>There may be genetic and hormonal factors that influence the development of bulimia nervosa. People with first-degree relatives who have an eating disorder are more likely to develop an eating disorder themselves.</p>
        <h3>Psychological</h3>
        <p>Psychological and emotional issues can contribute to the onset of bulimia. People with bulimia may have low self-esteem, perfectionism, impulsive behaviors, and an excessive need for approval.</p>
        <h3>Environmental</h3>
        <p>The influence of societal attitudes toward body image, family dynamics, and life events can also play a role. Stressful life changes and trauma are common environmental factors linked to bulimia.</p>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>While there is no surefire way to prevent bulimia nervosa, these strategies can help reduce the risk:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourage healthy eating habits and realistic attitudes toward food and body image.</li>
            <li>Discuss the dangers of dieting and promote balanced nutrition.</li>
            <li>Foster a positive body image and self-esteem.</li>
            <li>Encourage open communication and provide a supportive environment.</li>
            <li>Educate about the impact of media and cultural pressures on body image.</li>
        </ul>
