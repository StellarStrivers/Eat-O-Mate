        <h1>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)</h1>
        <p>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is an eating disorder that involves limitations in the amount or type of food consumed, but unlike anorexia nervosa, it does not involve distress about body shape or size, or fears of fatness. People with ARFID may avoid certain foods or restrict their intake due to sensory issues, fear of choking or vomiting, or a lack of interest in eating.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Significant weight loss or failure to achieve expected weight gain in children</li>
            <li>Nutritional deficiencies</li>
            <li>Dependence on nutritional supplements or enteral feeding</li>
            <li>Interference with psychosocial functioning</li>
            <li>Avoidance of foods based on their sensory characteristics (appearance, smell, texture, taste)</li>
            <li>Fear of negative consequences of eating (choking, vomiting, allergic reactions)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to see a doctor?</h2>
        <p>If you or someone you know exhibits symptoms of ARFID, it is important to seek professional medical help. Early intervention can prevent complications related to nutritional deficiencies and improve overall health. Contact a healthcare provider if you notice significant weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, or a persistent lack of interest in food.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>The exact cause of ARFID is not fully understood. It may result from a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors.</p>
        <h3>Biological</h3>
        <p>Genetic and biological factors may play a role in the development of ARFID. Some individuals may have heightened sensitivity to sensory input, making certain foods unpleasant or intolerable.</p>
        <h3>Psychological</h3>
        <p>Psychological factors, such as anxiety or a history of traumatic experiences with eating (e.g., choking or vomiting), can contribute to the development of ARFID. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders are at higher risk.</p>
        <h3>Environmental</h3>
        <p>Environmental influences, including cultural attitudes toward food and eating, family dynamics, and exposure to stressful events, can also contribute to ARFID. Early childhood experiences with food and eating can have a lasting impact.</p>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>While there is no guaranteed way to prevent ARFID, the following strategies can help reduce the risk:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourage a positive and stress-free eating environment.</li>
            <li>Expose children to a variety of foods and sensory experiences in a positive manner.</li>
            <li>Promote healthy attitudes toward food and eating without pressure or force.</li>
            <li>Address any anxiety or fear related to eating early on with professional help.</li>
            <li>Foster open communication and provide support for any food-related concerns.</li>
        </ul>
