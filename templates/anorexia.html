        <h2>When to see a doctor?</h2>
        <p>If you or a loved one is experiencing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, it is crucial to seek medical help immediately. Early intervention can significantly improve the chances of recovery. Contact a healthcare provider if you notice extreme weight loss, unusual eating habits, or obsessive thoughts about weight and dieting.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>The exact cause of anorexia is unknown. As with many diseases, it's probably a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors.</p>
        <h3>1. Biological</h3>
        <p>Although it's not yet clear which genes are involved, there may be genetic changes that make some people at higher risk of developing anorexia. Some people may have a genetic tendency toward perfectionism, sensitivity, and perseverance â€” all traits associated with anorexia.</p>
        <h3>2. Psychological</h3>
        <p>Some people with anorexia may have obsessive-compulsive personality traits that make it easier to stick to strict diets and forgo food despite being hungry. They may have an extreme drive for perfectionism, which causes them to think they're never thin enough. And they may have high levels of anxiety and engage in restrictive eating to reduce it.</p>
        <h3>3. Environmental</h3>
        <p>Modern Western culture emphasizes thinness. Success and worth are often equated with being thin. Peer pressure may help fuel the desire to be thin, particularly among young girls.</p>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>There is no guaranteed way to prevent anorexia nervosa. However, some strategies may help reduce the risk:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourage healthy eating habits and realistic attitudes about food and body image.</li>
            <li>Discuss the dangers of restrictive dieting and the importance of balanced nutrition.</li>
            <li>Promote body positivity and self-esteem.</li>
            <li>Encourage open communication and provide a supportive environment.</li>
            <li>Educate about the effects of media and cultural pressures on body image.</li>
        </ul>
